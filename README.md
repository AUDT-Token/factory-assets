# EPS Factory Assets
Repository for teams to provide assets for their factory pools.

## Add tokens for your factory pool

Clone this repo and add a directory named after your pool in the assets directory. Files should be PNG format and 240px x 240px. Name the files with the uppercase token symbol and then append `-logo.png` as seen in `assets/example`.

Submit a pull request and the EPS team will merge or comment.
